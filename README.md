# Hotel Room Pricing Regression Project


A Linear Regression model to predict the hotel prices in Jeju Island to understand important pricing factors/variables and help travelers estimate their travel expenses

## Introduction
As the restrictions on overseas travel persist amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Jeju Island has been one of the favorite tourist destinations in the nation and is expected to continue to be one of the favorite until the end of the pandemic. The purpose of this project is to analyse pricing strategy of hotels in Jeju Island and estimate budget for hotel accomodation. The data used for modeling was extracted from Interpark Hotel (http://hotel.interpark.com) using selenium while the data from Booking.com was collected using an Apify actor (https://blog.apify.com/crawling-booking-com-47511a59eef). The data includes various attributes such as check-in date, name, price, star, rating score, review counts and other features.
